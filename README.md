#My top Favorite Anime Series#
#Dragon ball 
The iconic Kamehameha wave was inspired by a move from a Bruce Lee movie called "Finger Dart Popping". Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, was a fan of Bruce Lee and incorporated this move into his series.
# Dororo
The series delves into themes of morality, human nature, and the consequences of greed. It explores the idea of what it means to be human and the value of life.
# Haikyu
Haikyuu! beautifully showcases the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and the power of believing in oneself. It's a story that inspires viewers to strive for their goals, no matter how challenging they may seem.
